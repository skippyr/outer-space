# Outer Space

A ZSH-theme with an outer space thematic.

![](./images/preview.png)

Colors may be different in your setup as it depends of your terminal emulator's theme.
In the preview, the theme was used in the [Kitty terminal emulator](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) with the [Dracula theme](https://github.com/dracula/kitty) and Jetbrains Mono Nerd Font.

It shows:

* your user and hostname.
* virtual environment that you have sourced.
* your current directory abbreviated.
* if inside a repository, the branch and if it has changes to commit.

## Installation

* install `git` and a font patched by the [Nerd Fonts project](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
* clone this repository.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/skippyr/outer_space ~/.local/share/zsh/themes/outer_space
```

* add a source rule in your `~/.zshrc` file to include the theme in the startup.

```bash
source ~/.local/share/zsh/themes/outer_space/outer_space.zsh-theme
```

* reopen ZSH.
